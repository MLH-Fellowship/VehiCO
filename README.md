 <p align="center"> VehiCO<sub>2</sub> (pronounced Vehicle) is a webapp that aims to help users be more environmentally-conscious and make informed decisions by comparing the CO<sub>2</sub> emission of different transportation modes for their trip. We also encourage users to take actions and contribute to sustainability efforts by providing a convenient way for them to neutralize their emission by donating to plant trees.

### View Map Route and Trip Report for different transportation modes 🚴‍

You can view the distance, travel duration, and CO2 emission (in ton) based on your trip's origin and destination. To put your trip's CO2 emission into perspective, we also provided a chart comparing your trip's emission with other contexts! Once you decide on the transportation mode of your choice, you can get more detailed directions and routing by selecting Get Directions.

### Neutralize your trip's carbon emission with an offset donation 🌲

In addition to helping you make more informed decisions of your choice of transportation mode, we also provided a convenient way for you to offset your carbon emission by donating to climate change organizations to plant trees!
